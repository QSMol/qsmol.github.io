# QSMol Website

This is the website of our research collaboration between Durham University, Imperial College London, King's College London, and Birmingham University.

This website is powered by Jekyll with Bootstrap and Bootswatch. It is based on a template from the Allan Lab.

## How to update the website

You can update the website in two ways:

1. Edit and commit files one at a time directly in the repository on GitHub.
2. Preferred: make all changes locally, run the site locally to verify everything, then push one consolidated commit (or one small commit set) to the `gh-pages` branch. More details are below.


## GitHub Actions auto-build/deploy

This repository has a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the site when changes are pushed to the `gh-pages` branch.

- Trigger: push to `gh-pages` (or manual run from the Actions tab).
- Build step: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
- Deploy step: publishes the generated site to GitHub Pages.

In practice, each push to `gh-pages` automatically rebuilds and republishes the site.

## Local setup

This repository pins Jekyll to version `4.3.2` in `Gemfile`, so install dependencies through Bundler from this repo folder.

### 1. Install Ruby

On Windows, install **Ruby+Devkit** from RubyInstaller:

- https://rubyinstaller.org/

Choose a recent Ruby 3.x build with Devkit, then complete the MSYS2 prompt that appears at the end of install.

### 2. Install Bundler

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
gem install bundler
```

### 3. Install this site's gems

From the project root (this folder), run:

```bash
bundle install
```

This installs Jekyll `4.3.2` and the exact supporting gems from `Gemfile.lock`.

### 4. Serve locally

To start the website, in the project root (this folder), run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open:

- http://127.0.0.1:4000/

While `bundle exec jekyll serve` is running, local changes are detected and the site is rebuilt automatically. When you are ready to publish updates, commit your changes and push to GitHub (the `gh-pages` branch).

### If `bundle` is not found

Close and reopen your terminal after installing Ruby/Bundler, then try again.

### If Bundler version mismatch appears

This repo lockfile was generated with Bundler `2.3.7`. If needed, install that version explicitly:

```bash
gem install bundler:2.3.7
```
